# Music Genre Classifier

## Description

Lyrics Genre Classification is a project that leverages natural language processing techniques to classify the genre of a song based on its lyrics. The project uses machine learning models to automatically categorize songs into predefined genres such as Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Country, and more. This can be a valuable tool for music enthusiasts, recommendation systems, and music streaming platforms.

## Features

- Text preprocessing: The project preprocesses the song lyrics to remove stopwords, punctuation, and perform stemming to prepare the text data for modeling.
- Machine learning models: It uses various machine learning algorithms or deep learning techniques for genre classification.
- Evaluation metrics: The project provides insights into model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Custom dataset support: You can use your own dataset of labeled song lyrics to train and test the model.
